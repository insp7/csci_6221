To decide which columns to remove based on low correlation with the target variable ('Target'), you can set a correlation threshold and remove columns with correlations below that threshold. Here, I'll suggest removing columns with an absolute correlation coefficient less than 0.1 (you can adjust this threshold as needed). Here are some columns to consider removing:

Nationality: Since its correlation is very close to zero (-0.004740), it may not have a significant impact on the target variable.

Mother's qualification: With a correlation of -0.038346, it appears to have a weak relationship with the target variable.

Father's qualification: Similarly, with a correlation of 0.000329, it seems to have little influence on the target variable.

Educational special needs: This column has a low correlation of -0.007353, suggesting it may not strongly affect the target variable.

International: With a correlation of 0.003934, this column has minimal impact on the target variable.

Curricular units 1st sem (without evaluations): It has a correlation of -0.068702, which is relatively low compared to other columns related to curricular units.

Unemployment rate: This column's correlation of 0.008627 indicates a weak relatxionship with the target variable.

Inflation rate: With a correlation of -0.026874, it has a relatively low impact on the target variable.

These columns have low absolute correlation values and may not provide significant predictive power for your target variable 'Target.' However, before removing them, consider the context of your analysis and whether these columns may have any theoretical significance or could be useful in a broader context. Additionally, it's a good practice to run your analysis both with and without these columns to see if they make a meaningful difference in your model's performance.

Let's plot the Top 10 Features with Highest Correlation to Target
